January 12, 2016. First, thank you 2015, and all the years before.  Now, in 2016, the Future has arrived including self-driving cars, personal flying transport, crowd-sharing utilitarianism, hover-boards and cognitive systems. We have moved beyond visions of transformative technology and are actually radically transforming what we do and how we do it. The vision is clear and the foundation is in place to enable astute citizens to live sustainable, enjoyable, fair, healthy, safe, friendly and fun lifestyles of learning, motivated creative composition, collaboration and expression. The technologies introduced in 2015 and all the years before will free many of us to address the environmental and social problems that inhibit our civilization from creating a sustainable and smart planetary environment where each human has the opportunity to live a safe, enjoyable, sustainable, and opportunity-filled lifestyle, while caring for our fragile homeworld.
<br/><br/>
In 2015, many technologies became mature.  In 2015 LED lighting and energy efficient controls became cost-effective; Uber and AirBnb transformed the transportation, travel and other idle resource value chains; Kickstarter and Patronicity transformed venture funding; DevOps and Design drove construction of continuously improving rapidly deployed collaborative creations; Google InBox and Verse optimized e-mail work flows; and Slack tamed group chat. Meanwhile, security technologies battled terrorism and fraud schemes by establishing new levels of tracking and notifications. 
<br/><br/>
In 2015, the connected societies jointly engaged in improving environmental sustainability and acted on containing terrorism with an unprecedented global mindfulness of purpose and planetary self-awareness. Socially, the collaborating global populous has evolved such that tolerance of peaceful, productive, and fair minded behavior without regard to the cultural or religious basis which motivates the behavior is now accepted as a meme of sustainability. This is in dramatic opposition to the tragic results of isolationist, anarchists, and the mentally ill who continue to turn their fear into violence amid peaceful endeavors. Meanwhile psychology can pinpoint specific behavior patterns and even chemical, physical and genetic markers that help us understand, forgive, and treat or contain those acting menacing or otherwise dangerously sociopathically. We individually see ourselves as contributors and consumers interacting in a global culture. Many have learned to understand and moderate individual behavior, on a global scale, to improve efficiency, happiness, and sustainability; for example, participation in recycling and containment of toxic waste are common sense behaviors among astute citizens.
<br/><br/>
Throughout society we saw 2015 as one the busiest and best years for decades, with new opportunities and responsibilities and many challenges coming from every context. In the midst of rapid social change, technology also evolved rapidly in 2015. In 2015 with Watson and Bluemix and other AI and cloud platforms, along with the tools of Cognitive Era, we have an ever-expanding API library codifying a wide and deep precedent of capabilities with which to plug together, build and deploy tools that do amazing things. When coupled with the "Diamond Age" manufacturing techniques available in 2015, we are seeing incredible things being conceived and built very quickly. In 2015, hand waiving and pontificating about your big idea became old school... in 2015, if you have a big idea take some time or create a community to sell the idea into and go build it. The tools are proven.
<br/><br/>
In 2015 we saw our lives dramatically change for the better with fundamentally new ways to communicate, organize, travel and create. Technologies blended and stacked to revolutionize supply chains, call centers, health care, travel, design, funding and manufacturing. Week-by-week in 2015, 3D printing showed it is the future of manufacturing, as demonstrated by the Stradivarius quality sound from 3D printed alien violins. In 2015 we saw the introduction of practical 3D printed houses, cars, electronics, glass, prosthetic limbs, and food. Similarly robotics and drones made astonishing and disruptive advances.  Meanwhile, the cost and price of many great technologies dropped dramatically, bringing even the lowest income brackets affordable brilliant TV's, and those one step up can now enjoy smartphones, pads, and wifi. In 2015 I joyfully learned to fly a $60 drone to photograph my leaking roof vent, and we all saw spectacular aerial photography and space travel scenes from our small planet.  Meanwhile smart schools gave children iPads and Chromebooks, while new learning psychology led to innovations such as recess coaches to help resolve conflict and set children's minds free. In 2015 it was easy to find a 9 year old on the Robotics squad able to expound on how it all worked. This next generation of learners, gifted with the tools of 2015, are poised to be the brilliant ones. They are just in time to help elevate those among us who are repressed, fearful, angry and dangerous.
<br/><br/>
In 2015, utopian ideals envisioned for a vibrant and sustainable civilization were presented as working technologies and social networks, implementing economic and political policies that affected every human's lifestyle and priorities.  Meanwhile, privacy ended for anything you do not personally secure.  Every transaction is traceable. Money is held in account. Every public and many private spaces can be easily monitored. We all experienced an ever shrinking sphere of secrecy, yet this smaller sphere is more secure and more protected than ever before. For any enterprise, the social penalty for allowing a breech is severe and expensive, so extensive investment was made in creating more secure firewalls and more insightful fraud detection and prosecution.
<br/><br/>
In 2015 the availability of location tracking, click-by-click data points, advanced Big Data analytics and personalized marketing in retail have transformed sales models and distribution, improved customer satisfaction, and helped bridge online marketing and sales to both mobile and brick-and-mortar. In data centers, enterprise topologies continued to adopt cloud templates across supply chain workflows. System instances were easily deployed to optimize dispersed collaboration and negotiation among stakeholders and contributors. Contributing to the acceleration of transformation in 2015 was the industry-wide deprecation of ancient browsers and adoption of HTML5, which drew cheers from web developers and enabled spectacular yet simpler web site and application designs.
<br/><br/>
In 2015 enterprises adopted game-changing innovations resulting in significant improvements in collaboration and automation. Online tools offer unprecedented process optimization, tracking and flexibility. For DevOps we saw developers delivering code to automated builds feeding test suites driving agile process flows across distributed repositories servicing world-wide non-stop development teams deploying continuous updates to cloud virtual machines, and it all works. Furthermore, these systems are designed so anyone on the team can service or improve them.  Agile became normal, along with continuously collaborative business processes and managed artifact workflows. DevOps automation enabled short delivery cycles and transparent partnerships among stakeholders. Management and Human Resources systems were transformed as tracked work products and online activities provided a sense of metrics to each employee's intellectual, social, and administrative contributions. Business operations improved with the deployment of Notes Verse, seamless live meeting streaming, advanced training applications, and simple file sharing. Many teams adopted Slack for rapid collaboration while intranet app stores allowed seamless application deployments including backup ssystem, productivity apps, and integrated management and security daemons.
<br/><br/>
In 2015, enterprises revised employee assessment practices to promote improved teamwork and motivation, then backed the approach with new tools offering checkpoint feedback and progres tracking.  Many teams became certified in strict data storage security practices and adopted use of secure collaboration zones for sharing high-value and sensitive artifacts. Use of cloud virtual machines for development, testing and support is ubiquitous, while the new web server profiles allowe ddeployments to greatly reduce application utilization requirements.
<br/><br/>
In 2015 agile-speed product management teams utilized advanced design studios and languages to dramatically change how products are conceived, monetized, and perceived. Many teams adopted a "Design Thinking" approach that allowed the teams to engage in a very simple state of mind and behavioral approach that enabled continuous creative progress, and the results have been fast and fabulous. Enterprises adopted new internal systems, organizations and culture to collaboratively manage each employees priorities, contributions and assessment. This enables an optimized and continuously improving infrastructure that empowers its teams to rapidly create innovative, design-based and transformative offerings in partnership with its clients and providers.
<br/><br/>
In 2015 we saw enterprises adopt a bimodal investment strategy. Bimodal project management allows companies to nurture both agile and controlled product lines and business work flows. This approach allows rapidly changing and high-growth product lines to flourish while maintaining the stable evolution of mission-critical profit centers.  In 2015 companies progressively adopted hybrid-cloud, API ecosystem, and cognitive solutions. In 2015, new offerings and acquisitions created structured value chains, lightspeed collaboration, designed monetization and end-to-end automation within this organized chaos. Softare no longer became a product or a service, but rather is used to create an ecosystem for performing high speed business, governance, and development of creative innovations.
<br/><br/>
Highlighted 2015 innovations include:
<br/><br/>
The introduction of the Cognitive Era;
The formation of advanced healthcare conglomerates to create advances in imaging analytics capabilities;
The formation of advanced weather prediction conglomerates leading to better data analytics;
The partnerships among data lakes providing advanced cognitive computing for decision making across science, legal, tax, and finance;
The availability of Artificial Intelligence and deep learning API's, multi-lingual analysis, and advanced image processing;
The delivery of mainframe systems consisting of the most sophisticated computer systems ever built;
Enhancements to cloud developers with the delivery of thousands of API additions and frameworks;
The emergence of managed BYOD devices enabled a sane and secure mix of business and personal computing;
The formation of the Blockchain project in the Linux open source foundation opened the door to transaction and value-chain optimizations;
The availability of the WebSphere Liberty Profile and advanced web server profiles provided simplified and minimized app server deployment;
The use of SAFe and other variations of Agile, refactoring of JazzHub, and optimizations for Product Line Engineering solutions using DevOps Services;
The broad adoption of OSLC and REST across vendor offerings enabled seamless integration among a wide range of tools and services;
The pervasive use of agile and radical collaboration; and,
The formation of marketplaces that created an API economy.
<br/><br/>
These and countless other advancements add up to making 2015 a huge break-out year. The Cognitive Era is backed by a sky-high tower of wondrous technology, spectacular even in it's first year out of the box.
<br/><br/>
In 2015 industries established end-to-end capabilities for handling streaming data, visualizing deep data analytics, and managing process flows across a broad range of silos, while still staying focused on the delivery of specific cognitive and collaborative solutions to targeted customer domains such as health, insurance, education, weather, and supply chain management. In addition, learning systems work with the best data on the planet (medical images, climate history, science, legal, finance) and partnerships among the best experts and best companies in the world are training these cognitive systems in how to ingest, interpret, evaluate and visualize this unique corpus of data.  What makes this even more extraordinary is that as Watson and other AI systems learn a domain, it can reuse that learned context to apply it to other customer problems in the same domain and similar domains. For example, learning about cooking might give and AI chemical expertise in how to clean food stains from surfaces.  Cognitive systems will improve over time through the training the AI gets through human usage. For cognitive computing, each AI gets further ahead of it's competitors each day the learning systems are in use. It is a race among competitors establishing their data corpus and domain experience. 
<br/><br/>
In 2015 Cloud systems matured to enable the effortless deployment of hybrid shared resources, driving down TCO and creating new kinds of apps and services. More importantly, this model of spawning templates of purpose-built servers simplifies tedious technical environment building tasks and made development and support much more enjoyable.  
<br/><br/>
2015 was the tipping point for social and technological global transformation around collaboration and value chain management, anticipating a massive shift in business operations, employee and consumer values and lifestyles. For many of us in 2015, life got better through better collaboration and insight built upon layers upon layers of rock-solid technology and design.  The foundation was been built to offer consumers capabilities indistinguishable from magic. And they like it.
<br/><br/>
But hold on to your VR goggles because "you aint seen nothing yet". 
<br/><br/>
In 2016 we are moving beyond establishing foundations, socializing methodologies, crowdsourcing resources, and start-up refactorings. 
<br/><br/>
In 2016 the tools of the Cognitive Era will wrap end-to-end value chains and transform everything. Nearly every new powered device will include onboard sensors and CPUs to optimize it's operation and maintenance. Reference standard deployment stacks will emerge to enable management and interchange among connected things. DevOps will be everywhere,  managing the secure deployment of software updates for these things. Large development teams will create precisely engineered marvels built from parts sourced around the world, while small development teams will create amazing contraptions with minimal investment.
<br/><br/>
In 2016, virtual worlds and the infrastructure to support them will transform learning and game playing. We will see environments like Second Life and Eve in full 3D immersion. New virtual worlds will compete for citizens, and we will see the emergence of new marketplaces for locations, stylistic design alternatives and virtual wares.
<br/><br/>
In 2016 we will see the rise of the Internet of Things using automated, secure and process-driven DevOps. IoT developers are now ultimately responsible for the development, deployment and maintenance of software running in billions of connected devices.  For example, when a power company upgrades it's power management grid, the refrigerators in the service area may need to be upgraded to provide additional sensor data or respond to power optimization requests. The software that is deployed in this ecosystem must be developed to be completely secure, compliant and reliable, then seamlessly deployed without disruption. This is what DevOps for IoT entails: end-to-end secure and collaborative development and deployment of intellectual artifacts. In large IoT systems comprised of multiple sensors, processors and networks, DevOps systems accelerate collaboration, manage the value chain, enforce policy guidelines, and track project costs. For example, deploying an energy management system in a service area may require multiple teams from different companies, geographies and cultures to collaborate on creating effective API's, services, specifications, form factors, sensors, tools, controls and parts. DevOps for IoT enables a company to establish an ecosystem of collaboration among suppliers and consumers and manage the progress, cost, and expectations when delivering these complex systems.  In 2016 development value chains will scale up again while time to market will shrink again.
<br/><br/>
In 2016, software developers will see an emphasis on "reuse or write-once". If an existing API cannot be found, now assisted by the cognitive systems, then the newly needed API should be designed to be shared, monetized, and reused in the ecosystem of cloud-enabled services. For example, various templates provide fast-starts for many kinds of apps; writing a new app reuses and entire stack of API's and can be completed in minutes. If, for example, a cooking App wanted to get the average barometric pressure from the phones in the restaurant to properly bake the soufflé, a new API may be needed to query the phones nearby. This API could be written and contributed to the API economy. If new API is created using the policies enforced by the DevOps system -- for example, that each function is validated by a test case suite -- and the reputation of the creator or foundry is secure, then future App developers can choose to consume this API rather than write their own.  In the past, the challenge to large-scale API sharing has been finding the right API to solve a particular problem, and compensating contributors. Now an API can be found in a huge library by asking few questions, while foundry compensation is now built-in to the API ecosystem.
<br/><br/>
In 2016 we will see the emergence of vibrant marketplaces for API's, intellectual contributions, and Design. The API Economy is driving new industries and exchange models, while accelerating innovation for all contributors and consumers in the ecosystem. DevOps is at the heart of this transformation, responsible for managing IT assets and their linkage to deployed apps, instances, and devices.
<br/><br/>
In 2016, the instant distribution of value via Blockchain will transform how contracts are made and fulfilled. This technology will enable supplies in motion to carry their own secure and redundant ledger, rather than relying on a connection to a data center. This will radically transform distribution networks and will simplify the management of transactions for everyone in the supply chain. A similar transformation will be made for intellectual artifacts, where Blockchain ledgers will handle the chain-of-possession,  contribution, and consumption; and thus it's value.
<br/><br/>
In 2016, programming will be fun, thrilling and challenging. The learning curve for understanding this new technology can daunting. An enterprise app in 2016 may include something like:
<br/><br/>
    Foundation+AI+Messaging+Blockchain+Security+Cloud-Deployment+Design+<br/>
     [your-app bridge-to-legacy-data]+[your-app bridge-to-devices][your-app foundation]+[your-app app]<br/>
          +[your-app test-suite]+[your-app build-definition]+[your-app deployment-definition]+[your-app maintenance-definition]<br/>
          +[next-app bridge-to-your-app]<br/>
          <br/>
This awesome stack is supported by crowds of contributors. The creators and consumers of each layer of technology must be versed in a broad scope of API's, standards, and execution contexts. Everything needs to be completely stable.  Stakeholders need to collaborate to negotiate scope and standards, while remaining true to the meme of rapid agile, radical collaboration, test-backed, and design-driven application and service development.
<br/><br/>
In 2016 two-speed bimodal transformation will help growing companies grow faster and stronger. We will see DevOps everywhere as the ease and optimization experienced managing of development assets spreads up the value chain such that all essential contributions become managed assets. Meanwhile business mega-mergers and partnerships will occur to create end-to-end value chains to take advantage of economies of scale, the optimization of entire workflows, work forces, and value systems.  The rapid disruption and formation of new economies and opportunities will result in a huge boom of small teams writing big-value apps,  API's and Designs.
<br/><br/>
In 2016 we will see a radical transformation in health care practices. Already automated systems are available to query about specific conditions and health. Private, personal, insight. The next step is to connect the incoming health records and doctor interviews with imaging and test results, then track these to treatments, which are monitored by wearable fitness trackers and apps. Health and fitness tracking will become common sense. The end-to-end tracking of detection, treatment and outcome will enable to new insights in disease management for both individuals and within populations and locations.
<br/><br/>
In 2016 we will see many technologies bend the boundaries of intellectual property, political affiliation and monetary value. We are building industries without boundaries by building an open, secure, enterprise-class ecosystem where new ideas, work flows, and approaches can easily be added and enhanced. Smarter leaders will adopt a fair approach to adapting to these transitions, so the populous remains motivated and engaged in productivity and sustainable creative expression.  In 2016 our individual and shared prosperity will depend on our ability to learn, adopt new ideas, and adapt.
<br/><br/>
If 2015 was a tipping point, it was like tipping into to the gravitation well of a black hole where time accelerated and space compressed. We are beyond the event horizon, and many of the transformations before us are now inevitable. The technical and social changes witnessed in 2015 were unprecedented in the history of mankind.  Some are calling it the Information Revolution. In 2016 we will see this rapid pace of change accelerate, with more change and opportunity than can ever be tracked and reacted to by any person. Fortunately, with AI and the tools of the Cognitive Era, we can visualize and understand our changing world faster and with more insight than ever before.
<br/><br/>
Meanwhile, creative expression is still the last profit center held by humans. Within a few generations, cognitive and robotic technology evolution will be able to perform almost all manual tasks while many administrative functions will be able to be handled by software ecosystems, cognitive algorithms, and enabled devices.  In such a world, imagination, expression and passion become the value-add of humans.
<br/><br/>
All the better when we apply these traits to improving lifestyles, optimizing utilization, enabling creative endeavors, contributing to collaborative industries, and establishing a sustainable homeworld civilization.
